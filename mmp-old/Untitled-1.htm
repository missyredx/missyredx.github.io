<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#990033">Who We 
  Are</font> </b></font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font size="2">The organization 
  was founded in 1989 by Patrick Reynolds, a grandson of the founder of the R.J. 
  Reynolds Tobacco Company. A former pack-a-day smoker, he saw his father, oldest 
  brother and other relatives die from cigarette-induced emphysema and cancer. 
  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerned about the widespread 
  death, disease, and economic hardship caused by tobacco, Patrick Reynolds divested 
  his RJR stock, quit smoking and became, in the words of former Surgeon General 
  C. Everett Koop, &quot;one of the nation's most influential advocates of a smokefree 
  America.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since first speaking out 
  publicly in 1986, Mr. Reynolds has testified before Congress, as well as State 
  and municipal legislatures, on a wide range of tobacco issues. His actions have 
  earned him the praise and admiration of his colleagues, including the World 
  Health Organization, which honored him in 1988, and the Mount Sinai Hospital 
  Group of Chicago, which named him &quot;Humanitarian of the Year&quot; in 1989. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Patrick Reynolds' name, 
  his story and his dedication to improving the health of present and future generations 
  make him a unique and powerful spokesman against smoking. </font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#990033">Successes</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each year since founding 
  The Foundation for a Smokefree America, Mr. Reynolds has spoken before dozens 
  of universities, high and middle schools, and before numerous health conferences 
  and medical forums. The press has been invited to the great majority of his 
  talks, and his appearances have received wide and very positive coverage in 
  print and broadcast media. In this way he has helped build excellent goodwill 
  for the Foundation. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mr. Reynolds was partly 
  motivated by the deaths of his father and other family members from tobacco 
  use, and partly by his own ten year struggle to break an addiction to cigarettes. 
  He has noted that, &quot;When my grandfather began manufacturing cigarettes 
  at the turn of the century, he did not know that smoking causes lung disease, 
  heart disease and cancer. Now that this has been absolutely proven, I want to 
  help people wake up to how addictive and poisonous cigarettes are.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since beginning his tobacco 
  free advocacy work in 1986, Mr. Reynolds has had nearly one thousand media interviews 
  in over 250 cities and in Europe, and has given numerous lectures before schools, 
  colleges, and health organizations. The organization has a mailing list of ten 
  thousand names nationally. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All of this has been accomplished 
  with part-time staff and a small home office. The successes to date have been 
  based on the dedication and knowledge of the founder, Patrick Reynolds, and 
  on the public response to his concerns. </font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#990033">Public 
  Response</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
  </font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Public response to Patrick 
  Reynolds' work, and resulting interest in The Foundation for a Smokefree America, 
  has been tremendous. Recent media coverage of Mr. Reynolds' lectures and news 
  conferences includes articles in the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, The Wall 
  Street Journal, Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, New York Daily News, Denver's 
  Rocky Mountain News, Arizona's Republic, Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World 
  Report, Associated press, Germany's Der Stern, Japan's Shinbun, and more. Mr. 
  Reynolds has also recently appeared on The today Show, Good Morning America, 
  CNN Headline News, Larry King Live, ABC World News, CNBC and many other prestigious 
  television programs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Foundation for a Smokefree 
  America has had success as a volunteer based organization. As a consequence 
  of Mr. Reynolds' lectures, television and radio appearances, hundreds of callers 
  who read about or saw Mr. Reynolds have phoned in to make donations or volunteer 
  time to The Foundation for a Smokefree America. Many of them are now assisting 
  the organization, or are on standby to give of their time and professional skills. 
  Their addresses, phone numbers and skills are always captured and entered into 
  our data base. Callers are often referred to local organizations in their own 
  cities, fighting for a particular issue the caller is interested in. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But public response has 
  overwhelmed the capacities of a volunteer-run organization. The Board of Directors 
  and Patrick Reynolds know it is time to hire additional staff for the organization. 
  Because of his commitment, for the first ten years, Reynolds allowed the organization 
  to operate out of his own modest home. This is a man whose work is worthy of 
  support; and the potential for the organization is enormous.</font></p>
